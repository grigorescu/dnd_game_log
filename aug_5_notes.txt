= Freeing the Winery from Feral Druids

== Approaching the Winery
The feral druids keep some kind of perimiter guard consisting of a few druids and a lot of animated pine-needle shooting branches. As it approaches, the party politely waits for Salvatore to nail them with a fireball, which we assume will be super-effective against being made out of dry pine needles.

Salvatore explains that he never learned the fireball spell. After a brief 'cheese shop'-style inquiry into what fire spells Salvatore *does* know, we learn Salvatore like to avoid avoids pretty much any kind of fire at all costs.

So instead, Corrian blows up most of the needle shooting twigs with a burst of thunder, ensuring that every druid anywhere nearby knows we have arrived.

Salvatore makes Rogar double in size, and Rogar uses smashing and fire breathing to clean up a lot of druid minions. Salvatore judiciously applies magic missles to stragglers.

While they dispatch druid mininos, Barry "beats the shit out of" the druids themselves. These encounters go fabulously badly for the druids, until one throws up a plant trap around Barry's legs in defense.

Moments later, the party learns exactly why Barry is normally so studious about using his speed to keep his distance from large groups of foes. The few remaining plant things swarm Barry. Shyrrik and Corrian have a quick conversation about why neither of them prepared much in the way of heal spells today, having anticipated spending the day mostly walking and then drinking wine. By the time they finish their chat Barry has vanished under the pile of attackers, and is either being surprisingly stoic about it, or is maybe just dead.

In spite of the risk of wasting it, Shyrrik breaks out what healing prayers he did prepare.  The powerful healing prayer targets everyone oin the party, and so patches up a small scratch that Courion had received from a glancing needle earlier in the scirmish.

Barry emerges from the pile of attackers, after a suitably suspenseful delay. 

Slash finishes off the remaining druid by delivering a pychic attack which the group assumes to be a concentrated essense of bagpipe, based on the druid's dying agony.

The group finds a lot of useless stuff and about a hundred copper on the bodies of the druids.

Salvatore conjures a magically tiny hut for the group to rest in. The party spends an uneventful evening recovering and trying to distract Slash long enough to drop copper pieces into his bagpipes.


== Inside the Winery
Sounds inside the winery make it clear that at least one feral druid remains, so the party heads inside to scout.

=== A Secret Door
Rogar quickly finds a secret door, which leads to a cave. Courion learns from the Ravens that the cave is full of danger. Since we heard the noises from the remaining druid on the second floor, the group leaves the secret door alone, for now.

=== A Kitchen
They find the winery kitchen, and decide to investigate very carefully. Several portions of meat, fish, and wine are determined not to contain the feral druid. The group decides that locating the remaining threat needs to take precedence over cleaning up after their meal, and so set out again.

=== An Opportunity for Theft
They search the winery bedrooms and find a rocking horse that is clearly a Blinksy Original, and a not-well-enough hidden key to the winery treasurey, which contains quite a bit of treasure. After carefully considering what sort of people they are, and whether such a theft could be traced back to them, they leave the treasure intact and return the key to its hiding place. Salvatore feels certain the theft would be noticed. Rogar hesitates to steal from potential allies. Barry simply can't be bothered with the extra weight. Shyrrik was careful to keep Courion out of the room during this conversation, as he felt certain Courion's new found Raven-ness would cloud the issue.

=== Druid with A Vampire Staff
The group catches up to the final druid, in the carriage building. The druid brags of the power given to him by his vampire staff. He doesn't brag for long, as Shyrrik blinds him, and then Rogar smashes him.

Salvatore studies the staff and determines that it is the Golthias staff - which is capable of stealing life from opponents. Barry determines "I could smack people with that."

=== Heading to Yesterhill

The group lets the wine keepers know it is safe to return to the winery, and that the feral druids left a mess in the kitchen. The monks ask the group to escort the next wine shipment back to Valaki. The party agrees after minimal haggling, since they are motivated to have the Blue Moon Inn to have a full supply of free-to-house-amor drinks.

But, following the logic of 'the wine must flow', the group heads first to Yesterhill to recover the minimal single gem needed to restore the winery to operation. They figure they'll grab the sacred sun sword if they happen to see it there, as well - it could be useful when they inevitably piss off Straud with their puppet.
